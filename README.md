This repo contains the code and assets used to generate a cookbook table submitted to the RStudio 2020 table [contest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/15/announcing-the-2020-rstudio-table-contest/). This particular table uses the [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) package to succinctly display a set of recipes along with instructions and helpful information. The table itself was inspired by the food themed functions in the recipes package.
